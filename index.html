<h1>Paul Thomas Anderson: Cinema's Greatest Auteur</h1>


<p>Ever heard of the filmmaker named Paul Thomas Anderson? Well, if you haven't you are surely missing out! He is great mind behind some of the greatest films of our generation. His films explore a plethora of attitudes and his oeuvre maps the ever so changing image of the "American Dream".</p>
    
<p>His films have ranged from a variety of time periods. In his challenging 2012 epic, "The Master" he explored post- WWII America through the eyes of a lost/PTSD stricken veteran. In his latest film, "Inherent Vice" he explores the drug infused 60's paranoia scene through the eyes of hippie detective Doc Sportello. His mangum opus, "Boogie Nights", inhabits the sex, drug, and rock and roll seventies. Essentially, his films have explored a myriad of land scapes and time periods yet they remain consistent in complexity and dynamic.</p>
    
<p>Paul Thomas Anderson is a self-taught filmmaker (in a sense). Like the many greats of the American indie explosion of the 90's (Tarantino, Linklater, Smith, Hartley, etc.) his passion for cinema exceeded his ability to attend University. Instead, of sitting and taking notes he just went out and began his career. In fact, he used his college tuition money to pay for his first couple of films. These films caught the attention of the Sundance Insititute. From there, he mentored under some of the great filmmakers and developed his style and cinematic tone. His first couple of short films were eventually developed into feature length films. Some of the films are considered modern american masterpieces by cinehpiles world wide!</p>
